# GridWorld-QLearning

This is an implementation of the Q-Learning Algorithm in the "Grid World" environment. To run the program, simply execute the "GridWorldVis.py" file. 

You can create your own custom grids and pass them to the program as well. The format for a "GridWorld" file is a comma seperate grid of numbers. 
A '0' represents a regular tile,'-1' represents a blocked tile, and any positive integer represents a "reward". To pass in the file, simply use the command line arguments "-graph [path_to_gridfile] -w [width of board] -l [length of board]"
